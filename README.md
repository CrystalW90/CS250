# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

One of the best ways to interpret user needs is to include current users in a focus group. As we saw in the SNHU Travel project, incorporating a focus group helps users to be able to tell you exactly what they'd like out of the software. Polling users and observing user behavior are other useful tools in interpreting user needs. Creating user stories helps to summarize the needs the users give you. User stories allow you to break down and rate the user needs and share them with the rest of the Agile team. They provide insight into what you will be working on during Sprints and can be broken down further into story points if needed.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The Agile principle most helpful is incorporating changes into the project while working on it. Changes requested by stakeholders or users seem to be common place when designing software, and other design methods, such as Waterfall, would have you wait until the end of the project in order to make those changes while Agile allows you to change things as they are being developed. This benefits the entire team and keeps them from having to make larger more in depth changes at the end of the project and helps the stakeholders to have a better idea of what the end product will be during the process. Agile's processes of incorporating user feedback through collaboration and delivering working software frequently are also practices that I would like to incorporate into my future development work. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means working well with others. In Agile, each team member is expected to participate in frequent group meetings where they share the work they've completed and are currently completing. They are encouraged to work with other team members often to do paired testing or even to teach newer team members how to use features they may not have experience with. Overall, being a good team member in software development means communicating with the team well and frequently, and delivering what you say you will deliver.
